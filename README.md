## Roadmap

Footsteps was created for educational purposes, which is why there is a lot more work that can be done here. If I would to continue its development, I would probably add the following:

* more steps (like license, contributing, dependencies management, etc...)
* automatic file creation
* steps completion checks
* leave Evergreen UI in favor Material Design
* consider adding MobX for steps movement
